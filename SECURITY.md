# Security Policy

## Reporting Security Vulnerabilities

We take the security of the FleetPulse infrastructure seriously. If you discover a security vulnerability, please follow these guidelines:

### How to Report

**Please do NOT create a public GitHub issue for security vulnerabilities.**

Instead, please report security vulnerabilities by:

1. **Email**: Send details to the repository maintainers (check CODEOWNERS file)
2. **GitHub Security Advisories**: Use GitHub's private vulnerability reporting feature
3. **Direct Contact**: Contact the project team through established secure channels

### What to Include

Please include the following information in your report:

- **Description**: A clear description of the vulnerability
- **Impact**: Assessment of the potential impact
- **Reproduction**: Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
- **Affected Components**: Which parts of the infrastructure are affected
- **Suggested Fix**: If you have suggestions for how to fix the vulnerability

### Response Timeline

- **Initial Response**: Within 48 hours of receiving the report
- **Assessment**: Complete assessment within 5 business days
- **Fix Development**: Security fixes will be prioritized and developed promptly
- **Disclosure**: Coordinated disclosure after fix is available

## Security Model

### Infrastructure Security

The FleetPulse Azure infrastructure implements defense-in-depth security:

#### Network Security
- **Private Networking**: All applications run on private networks with no public exposure
- **VPN Access**: Site-to-Site VPN required for all access from on-premises  
- **Internal Load Balancer**: Container Apps use internal-only networking
- **IP Restrictions**: Application-level access controls for trusted networks
- **Network Segmentation**: Separate subnets for different components

> **Note**: Azure Firewall was removed for cost optimization in this simple web app deployment. For expanded scope or stricter security requirements, consider adding Azure Firewall for centralized egress traffic control.

#### Identity and Access Management
- **Managed Identity**: All Azure service-to-service authentication uses managed identities
- **RBAC**: Role-based access control for all Azure resources
- **OIDC Federation**: GitHub Actions uses OIDC federation (no stored secrets)
- **Key Vault**: All secrets and certificates stored in Azure Key Vault with RBAC

#### Data Protection
- **Private Endpoints**: All Azure services (Key Vault, Storage, Application Insights) use private endpoints
- **Encryption in Transit**: TLS 1.2+ enforced for all communications
- **Encryption at Rest**: Azure Storage and Key Vault provide encryption at rest
- **Certificate Management**: SSL certificates managed through Key Vault

#### Application Security
- **Container Security**: Container images scanned for vulnerabilities
- **IP Restrictions**: Application ingress restricted to trusted networks only
- **Policy Enforcement**: Azure Policy prevents external network access
- **Security Headers**: Applications should implement appropriate security headers

### Operational Security

#### CI/CD Security
- **OIDC Authentication**: No long-lived secrets in CI/CD pipelines
- **Least Privilege**: Service principals have minimal required permissions
- **Audit Logging**: All CI/CD activities are logged and auditable
- **Secret Management**: All secrets managed through Azure Key Vault

#### Monitoring and Alerting
- **Security Monitoring**: Azure Monitor and Application Insights for security events
- **Audit Logs**: All Azure activity logged and monitored
- **Anomaly Detection**: Automated detection of unusual activities
- **Incident Response**: Documented procedures for security incidents

### Compliance and Governance

#### Azure Policy
- **Security Policies**: Enforced through Azure Policy assignments
- **Compliance Monitoring**: Regular compliance assessments
- **Remediation**: Automated remediation where possible

#### Data Governance
- **Data Classification**: All data properly classified and handled
- **Retention Policies**: Data retention according to business requirements
- **Privacy Protection**: No personal data exposed in logs or configurations

## Security Best Practices

### For Contributors

1. **Never commit secrets**: Use environment variables or Key Vault references
2. **Secure coding**: Follow secure coding practices for all infrastructure code
3. **Dependency management**: Keep all dependencies updated and scan for vulnerabilities
4. **Code review**: All changes must be reviewed before merging
5. **Testing**: Include security testing in all code changes

### For Operators

1. **Access Management**: Regularly review and audit access permissions
2. **Certificate Management**: Monitor certificate expiration dates and renew proactively
3. **Patch Management**: Keep all systems updated with latest security patches
4. **Backup Security**: Ensure backups are encrypted and access-controlled
5. **Incident Response**: Follow documented incident response procedures

### For Users

1. **VPN Security**: Ensure VPN connections are properly secured
2. **Network Security**: Only access applications from trusted networks
3. **Credential Security**: Use strong authentication methods
4. **Reporting**: Report any suspicious activities immediately

## Security Tools and Scanning

### Automated Security Scanning

The repository includes automated security scanning:

- **Terraform Scanning**: Checkov scans infrastructure code for security issues
- **Container Scanning**: Trivy scans container images for vulnerabilities
- **Dependency Scanning**: GitHub Dependabot monitors for vulnerable dependencies
- **Secret Scanning**: GitHub secret scanning prevents committed secrets

### Manual Security Reviews

Regular manual security reviews should include:

- **Architecture Review**: Assess overall security architecture
- **Configuration Review**: Review Azure resource configurations
- **Access Review**: Audit user and service account permissions
- **Network Review**: Validate network security controls

## Incident Response

### Security Incident Classification

**Critical (P0)**: 
- Active security breach or compromise
- Data exfiltration detected
- Unauthorized access to production systems

**High (P1)**:
- Security vulnerability affecting production
- Potential data exposure
- Failed security controls

**Medium (P2)**:
- Security misconfiguration
- Non-critical vulnerability
- Security policy violation

**Low (P3)**:
- Security improvement opportunity
- Documentation gaps
- Training needs

### Response Procedures

1. **Detection**: Identify and classify the security incident
2. **Containment**: Immediately contain the threat to prevent spread
3. **Investigation**: Conduct thorough investigation to understand scope
4. **Eradication**: Remove the threat and vulnerabilities
5. **Recovery**: Restore systems to normal operation
6. **Lessons Learned**: Document lessons learned and improve procedures

### Contact Information

For security incidents:
- **Immediate Response**: Contact on-call engineer (see CODEOWNERS)
- **Business Hours**: Contact project team leads
- **External Support**: Engage Microsoft Azure support for Azure-specific issues

## Security Updates and Communications

### Security Updates

Security updates will be communicated through:
- **GitHub Security Advisories**: For public vulnerabilities
- **Release Notes**: Security fixes included in release documentation
- **Direct Communication**: Critical security issues communicated directly to users
